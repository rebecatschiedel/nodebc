        <h2>The latest scoop on the health benefits of coffee</h2>

          What a difference a few years can make. Not long ago, I was learning
          about the dangers of coffee — how it could raise your blood pressure,
          make your heart race, impair sleep, and maybe even cause cancer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the World Health Organization (WHO) has taken coffee off the
          possible carcinogen list. And there’s increasing evidence that coffee
          might actually be good for you.
        </p>
        <p>What’s changed? It’s all about the evidence.</p>

      <h2>A cup of coffee a day keeps the doctor away</h2>
      <p>Paul Benedetti</p>
      <time>JUNE 30, 2009</time>
      <p>
        Every morning Lesli Boldt starts her day with a serious cup of coffee --
        a two-shot espresso with hot water. “I have one coffee a day and I want
        it to be a good one,” says Lesli, 35, a manager of marketing and
        communications for the Vancouver Public Library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only does Lesli's coffee taste good, but new research suggests that
        it may also be good for her. Recent studies have found that drinking
        coffee can actually be a healthy habit, enhancing athletic performance,
        increasing mental alertness and protecting against serious diseases such
        as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and even liver and colon cancers. “Coffee
        consumption fits into a very healthy diet and, if anything, may have a
        beneficial effect,” Dr. Eileen Madden, a toxicologist and food-safety
        expert, told a symposium on coffee and health last fall at the New York
        Academy of Sciences.
